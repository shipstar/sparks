- As a manager, your output is the sum of the output of your team and the teams you influence.
- What dashboard would I want to see each morning to determine current and future output?
- Pair quantitative with qualitative measurements to avoid over-optimizing either one
- Grove's Law -- all successful large orgs become hybrids
  - mix of "mission" (product lines) and "functional" (e.g. sales, engineering, marketing)
  - dual-reporting (basically guilds)
- Coordination methods:
  - Free market (value is clear to both sides)
  - Contract (unclear value, defines type of work and standards)
  - Culture
    - values
    - objectives
    - methods
  - Coordination method should be chosen based on individual motivation (self-interest, group interest) vs CUA: complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity (low, high)
    - self + low = free market
    - group + low = contract
    - group + high = culture
    - self + high = nothing works!
- Competency vs motivation
  - How do we get to self-actualization?
  - Sports analogies -- how to introduce competition (internal or external) as motivation?
- Task-relevant maturity (TRM)
  - low = structured, task-oriented, explain what/when/how
  - medium = individual-oriented, two-way, support, mutual reasoning
  - high = limited manager involvement, just objectives + monitoring
- Manager/Subordinate vs servant leadership -- has something changed? Only for reviews?
- Written review ahead of time
- see example performance evaluation document at the end of Chapter 13
- interview goals
   - technical knowledge
   - actions
   - gap between knowledge and actions
   - operational values
- 2 tools to improve performance: motivation and training
- Go through some of the exercises
